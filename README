WebHDFS-Ruby is a ruby library for accessing WebHDFS REST APIs

In webhdfs.rb I used rest-client(require 'rest_client') for uploading files, 
because for now (Ruby 1.9.3), the ruby library net/http do not support multipart/form-data itself

To install rest-client, run command:
gem install rest-client
